/*
Problem Statement
-----------------
Given a natural number N, find the count of numbers from 1 to N that have an odd number of divisors. 

 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 1
Output:
1
Explanation:
1 has only one 
divisor {1}.
 

Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
Output:
2
Explanation:
4 has an odd number 
of divisors {1, 2, 4}.
 

Your Task:

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function oddNumberOfDivisor() which takes an integer N and returns the count of numbers from 1 to n that have an odd number of divisors. 

 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

 

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 106

// Code:

return sqrt(N);
